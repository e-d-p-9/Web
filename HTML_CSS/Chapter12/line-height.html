        <h2>Breed History</h2>
        <p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, 
            has been bred for centuries to herd and protect sheep. The 
            breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers 
            and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense 
            of hearing. Briards were used in the first World War almost 
            to the point of extinction. Currently the population of 
            briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas 
            Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>
